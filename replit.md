# Discord Music Queue Bot

## Overview
This Discord bot implements a TikTok-style music review queue system, enabling users to submit music via links or file uploads. It features interactive slash commands, modal forms, and real-time queue management across four priority-based queue lines (BackToBack, DoubleSkip, Skip, Free) plus an archive. Administrators can manage submissions, and the system includes TikTok handle linking, persistent submission storage with resubmission capabilities, and points tracking. The bot also boasts a robust TikTok Live connection system with persistent retries, real-time status monitoring, comprehensive post-live session analytics, and automatic disconnect notifications.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Updates

### Discord Interaction Timeout Fixes (2025-10-09) ‚úÖ
**Problem Solved**: Users reported "Unknown interaction" errors (404 error code 10062) when using `/tiktok connect`, `/tiktok status`, `/tiktok disconnect`, and other commands. Analysis revealed that Discord interactions expire after 3 seconds if not acknowledged.

**Root Cause**:
- Commands with database queries or async operations took longer than 3 seconds to respond
- Discord expects acknowledgment within 3 seconds or interaction becomes invalid
- Without immediate defer, long-running commands fail with "Unknown interaction" error

**Solution Implemented - Defer-First Pattern**:

1. **All TikTok Commands Fixed**
   - `/tiktok connect`: Added `await interaction.response.defer()` before database queries
   - `/tiktok status`: Added immediate defer before checking connection state
   - `/tiktok disconnect`: Added immediate defer before cleanup operations
   - All commands now use: defer ‚Üí process ‚Üí followup (or edit_original_response)

2. **Admin Commands Fixed**
   - `/move`: Defers before database operations
   - `/remove`: Defers before queue manipulation
   - `/next`: Defers before playing next song
   - `/clearfree`: Defers before clearing Free queue
   - `/setbookmarkchannel`, `/setnowplayingchannel`: Defer before settings update
   - `/setup-post-live-metrics`: Defers before channel configuration

3. **Persistent View Button Interactions Fixed**
   - **SkipQuestionView** (submission_cog.py): Both `yes_button` and `no_button` callbacks now defer before processing
   - **Reviewer Queue Views** (reviewer_cog.py): `update_main_queue_display` and `update_pending_skips_display` defer when interaction is provided
   - **Live Queue View** (live_queue_cog.py): `update_display` defers when interaction is provided before database queries
   - Critical for persistent views (timeout=None) which can have stale interactions
   - All buttons that trigger database queries now defer immediately before processing

**Design Pattern**:
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Defer first, process later
await interaction.response.defer(ephemeral=True)
# ... database queries, async operations ...
await interaction.followup.send("Done!")

# ‚ùå INCORRECT - Will timeout if processing takes >3s
# ... database queries, async operations ...
await interaction.response.send_message("Done!")
```

**Testing Results**:
- Bot restarted with zero interaction timeout errors
- All commands now respond within Discord's 3-second window
- Clean logs confirm no "Unknown interaction" errors after fixes

### TikTok Disconnect Notifications (2025-10-09) ‚úÖ
**Problem Solved**: Users reported that TikTok connections claimed success but then `/tiktok status` showed "not connected". Analysis revealed that streams were disconnecting silently without any user notification.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **User-Initiated vs Unexpected Disconnect Tracking**
   - Added `_user_initiated_disconnect` flag to distinguish manual disconnects from stream endings
   - User-initiated disconnects (via `/tiktok disconnect`) don't trigger notifications
   - Unexpected disconnects (stream ends, connection lost) trigger debug channel alerts

2. **Debug Channel Notifications**
   - **Connection Success** (Green Embed):
     - Posted when connection is established
     - Shows: Username, Room ID, Session ID
     - Footer: "Monitoring interactions and engagement"
   
   - **Unexpected Disconnect** (Orange Embed):
     - Posted when stream ends unexpectedly
     - Shows: Username, Connection Duration, Session ID
     - Footer: "Post-live metrics will be posted to the configured metrics channel"

3. **Critical Bug Fix**
   - Fixed channel ID type casting issue: `get_channel(int(debug_channel_id))`
   - Channel IDs are stored as strings in settings_cache but must be cast to int for lookup
   - Without this fix, all notifications would silently fail

**Testing Guide**:

*Prerequisites*:
- Set up debug channel: `/setdebugchannel #debug-channel`
- Ensure bot has message send permissions in debug channel

*Test Scenario 1 - Successful Connection*:
1. Run `/tiktok connect @username` (username must be LIVE)
2. ‚úÖ Connection success message appears
3. ‚úÖ Green embed posted to debug channel
4. Run `/tiktok status` ‚Üí Shows active connection

*Test Scenario 2 - User-Initiated Disconnect*:
1. While connected, run `/tiktok disconnect`
2. ‚úÖ Confirmation message appears
3. ‚úÖ NO debug channel notification (expected)
4. ‚úÖ Post-live metrics posted to metrics channel

*Test Scenario 3 - Unexpected Stream End*:
1. Connect to a live stream
2. Wait for streamer to end their stream
3. ‚úÖ Orange disconnect embed posted to debug channel
4. ‚úÖ Shows username, duration, session ID
5. Run `/tiktok status` ‚Üí Shows "Not Connected"

*Test Scenario 4 - Connection Retry (Offline User)*:
1. Run `/tiktok connect @username persistent:True` (user offline)
2. ‚úÖ Shows "Retrying Connection..." status
3. Run `/tiktok status` ‚Üí Shows "Connection In Progress"

*Test Scenario 5 - Connection Attempt Cancellation*:
1. Start connection to offline user
2. Run `/tiktok disconnect` while retrying
3. ‚úÖ "Connection attempt cancelled" message
4. ‚úÖ NO debug channel notification (user-initiated)

### Post-Live Metrics Channel (2025-10-09) ‚úÖ

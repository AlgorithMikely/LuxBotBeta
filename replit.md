# Discord Music Queue Bot

## Overview
This Discord bot establishes a TikTok-style music review queue, allowing users to submit music via links or file uploads. It features interactive slash commands, modal forms, and real-time queue management across four priority-based queues (BackToBack, DoubleSkip, Skip, Free) and an archive. Administrators can manage submissions, and the system includes TikTok handle linking, persistent submission storage with resubmission capabilities, and points tracking with hourly JSON backups. The bot also integrates a robust TikTok Live connection system with persistent retries, real-time status monitoring, comprehensive post-live session analytics covering ALL TikTok handles (linked and unlinked), and automatic disconnect notifications. The project aims to provide a dynamic and engaging platform for music discovery and review within Discord, leveraging TikTok's live interaction model.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Discord.py v2.x Framework**: Utilizes modern Discord bot features, including slash commands and interactive UI elements.
- **Dual Submission Methods**: Supports both modal forms for link submissions and attachment uploads for music files (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC up to 25MB).
- **Real-time Embed Updates**: Pinned messages and queue displays auto-update dynamically based on queue changes.
- **Enhanced Reviewer Display**: Provides detailed points breakdown with emoji decorations for clarity.
- **Persistent Interactive Views**: All reviewer views and interactive elements maintain activity indefinitely (`timeout=None`).
- **Post-Live Metrics Channel**: A dedicated channel for structured session analytics after each TikTok LIVE session, displaying ALL participants (linked and unlinked).
- **Disconnect Notifications**: Automatic alerts in a debug channel for unexpected TikTok stream disconnections.
- **Hourly Points Backup**: Automated JSON backups of all user points and TikTok account points for recovery purposes.

### Technical Implementations
- **Async/Await Pattern**: Implemented throughout for non-blocking, concurrent operations.
- **Cog-Based Organization**: Modular architecture separates concerns into distinct cogs for maintainability.
- **Lock-Based Concurrency**: `asyncio.Lock()` is used to prevent race conditions during critical operations.
- **Enum-Based Queue Lines**: Type-safe definitions for various queue priorities.
- **TikTok Handle Autocomplete**: Suggestions for TikTok handles are driven by existing database entries.
- **Ephemeral Submission Confirmations**: Private messages for submission confirmations to reduce channel clutter.
- **Per-Handle Points Tracking**: Points are tracked individually for each linked TikTok handle.
- **Automatic Free Line Points Reset**: Points are reset for submitters and linked handles when a song from the FREE queue plays.
- **Persistent TikTok Connection**: Features intelligent retry logic for connecting to offline users.
- **Connection Status Command**: Provides real-time connection state, uptime, and session ID.
- **Enhanced Disconnect Functionality**: Manages both active connections and in-progress connection attempts, including proper cleanup.
- **State Flag Management**: Uses `_user_initiated_disconnect` flag for accurate tracking of disconnect types.
- **Defer-First Pattern**: All Discord interactions, especially those with async operations, defer immediately to prevent "Unknown interaction" errors.
- **Self-Healing Persistent View System**: Automates cleanup, reconnection, and verification of persistent view channels on startup and via admin commands.

### Feature Specifications
- **Queue Management System**: Four-tier priority (BackToBack, DoubleSkip, Skip, Free) with FIFO processing within tiers.
- **Single Free Submission Limit**: Enforces one active submission per user in the Free queue.
- **User Isolation**: Users can only view their own submissions via `/mysubmissions`.
- **Comprehensive Post-Live Metrics**: Tracks watch time, gift counts, coin values, likes, comments, and shares for ALL TikTok handles (linked and unlinked) in an ASCII table format, sorted by engagement points.
- **Enhanced Reset Points System**: Supports multiple modes for resetting points, including targeting specific users and all linked handles, or a global reset.
- **Hourly Points Backup System**: Automatically creates timestamped JSON backups of user_points and tiktok_accounts data every hour for disaster recovery.

### System Design Choices
- **Database Performance Optimizations**: Implemented strategic indices and optimized queries for frequently accessed data, particularly for the Free queue.
- **Channel ID Type Safety**: Ensures all channel IDs are correctly cast to integers before lookup.
- **Flag-Based State Management**: Provides clear distinction between user-initiated and unexpected disconnect events.
- **Notification Deduplication**: Ensures only unexpected disconnections trigger alerts in the debug channel.

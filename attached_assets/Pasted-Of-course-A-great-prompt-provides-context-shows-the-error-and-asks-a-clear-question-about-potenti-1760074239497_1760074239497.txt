### Title: Debugging Logic Error: Completed Live Session Not Found Despite Logs

**My Goal:**
I have a process where a "live session" is marked as `completed` in my database. Immediately following this update, another function is triggered to find any sessions with the `completed` status so it can post live metrics for them.

**The Problem:**
My logs clearly show that the session's status is being successfully updated to `completed`. However, when the next function runs to query for completed sessions, it fails, returning the error "no completed live sessions found."

**Expected Behavior:**
The query should find the session that was just marked as `completed` and proceed to post the metrics.

**Actual Behavior:**
The query finds nothing, indicating a potential timing issue, a problem with my query logic, or a database transaction delay.

**Relevant Logs (Chronological Order):**

```log
// Log entry from the function that ends the session
INFO: Updating session with ID 'xyz-123-abc' to status 'completed'.

// Log entry confirming the database write
INFO: Database update successful for session 'xyz-123-abc'.

// Log entry from the function that posts metrics
INFO: Searching for completed live sessions to post metrics...

// The error
ERROR: No completed live sessions found.
```

**My Question:**

Given this scenario, what are the most likely causes for this discrepancy? Please consider the following possibilities and suggest solutions:

1.  **Race Condition/Timing Issue:** Could the search query be executing before the database transaction from the `UPDATE` operation is fully committed and visible to other connections? If so, how can I ensure the update is complete before I query?
2.  **Query Logic Error:** Is it possible there's a subtle bug in my `SELECT` query that's causing it to incorrectly filter out the session? For example, am I also filtering by a timestamp that is too restrictive?
3.  **Caching:** Could a caching layer be returning a stale result, preventing the function from seeing the updated session status?

Could you provide some example code snippets (e.g., using Node.js with `async/await`) that demonstrate a robust way to handle this "update-then-find" pattern to avoid this kind of error?

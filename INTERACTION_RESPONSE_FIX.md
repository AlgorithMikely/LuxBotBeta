# Interaction Response Fix - Refresh & Pagination Buttons

## Issue Summary
The refresh and pagination buttons in both LiveQueueCog and ReviewerCog were throwing `InteractionResponded` errors after the bot was restarted or when auto-refresh occurred. This prevented users from interacting with queue displays.

## Root Cause
The code was calling `await interaction.response.defer()` but then attempting to use `await interaction.response.edit_message()` later. Once an interaction is deferred, you can no longer use `interaction.response.edit_message()` - you must use `interaction.edit_original_response()` instead.

## Solution Implemented

### Pattern Used
```python
# Before (BROKEN):
if interaction:
    await interaction.response.defer()
# ... later ...
if interaction:
    await interaction.response.edit_message(embed=embed, view=view)

# After (FIXED):
# Defer interaction if not already responded
if interaction and not interaction.response.is_done():
    await interaction.response.defer()
# ... later ...
if interaction:
    # Use edit_original_response after deferring
    await interaction.edit_original_response(embed=embed, view=view)
```

### Key Changes

1. **Check Before Defer**: Added `interaction.response.is_done()` check before deferring to prevent double-deferring
2. **Correct Edit Method**: Changed from `interaction.response.edit_message()` to `interaction.edit_original_response()`
3. **Consistent Pattern**: Applied the same fix across all button callbacks

### Files Modified

#### `cogs/reviewer_cog.py`
- Fixed `update_main_queue_display()` method (lines 118-120, 179-180)
  - Added `is_done()` check before defer
  - Changed to `edit_original_response()`
  
- Fixed `update_pending_skips_display()` method (lines 189-191, 227-228)
  - Added `is_done()` check before defer
  - Changed to `edit_original_response()`

#### `cogs/live_queue_cog.py`
- Fixed `update_display()` method (lines 88-90, 131-133)
  - Added `is_done()` check before defer
  - Changed to `edit_original_response()`

## Affected Components

### LiveQueueCog (Public Queue View)
- ✅ Previous button
- ✅ Next button
- ✅ Refresh button

### ReviewerCog (Reviewer Channel Views)
- ✅ Main Queue View - Previous button
- ✅ Main Queue View - Next button
- ✅ Main Queue View - Refresh button
- ✅ Pending Skips View - Previous button
- ✅ Pending Skips View - Next button
- ✅ Pending Skips View - Refresh button

## Testing Results

### Bot Restart Test
- ✅ Bot restarted successfully
- ✅ Both cogs loaded without errors
- ✅ Views re-registered successfully
- ✅ No `InteractionResponded` errors in logs

### Expected Behavior
- All buttons should respond instantly without errors
- Auto-refresh (5-second cycle) continues working without issues
- Pagination persists across bot restarts
- No double-defer or interaction conflicts

## Technical Details

### Why This Fix Works

1. **`is_done()` Check**: Prevents attempting to defer an already-responded interaction
2. **`edit_original_response()`**: Correct method to use after deferring an interaction
3. **Race Condition Prevention**: Guards against auto-refresh and manual button clicks interfering

### Discord.py Interaction Lifecycle
```
User clicks button
    ↓
interaction.response.is_done() == False
    ↓
interaction.response.defer()
    ↓
interaction.response.is_done() == True
    ↓
Must use: interaction.edit_original_response()
    ✅ (not interaction.response.edit_message())
```

## Architect Review
✅ **PASSED** - All interaction handling fixes verified:
- Correct defer pattern with `is_done()` guards
- Proper edit method after deferring
- All button callbacks fixed
- No race conditions
- Consistent pattern across both cogs

## Related Issues
- **Next Steps** (per architect): Monitor SubmissionCog modal callbacks for similar interaction handling issues (40060 error logged)
- Auto-refresh cycles continue to work as expected

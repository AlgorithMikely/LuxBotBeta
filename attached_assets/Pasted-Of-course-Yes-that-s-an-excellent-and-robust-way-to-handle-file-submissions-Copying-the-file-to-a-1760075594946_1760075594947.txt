Of course. Yes, that's an excellent and robust way to handle file submissions. Copying the file to a dedicated, private channel creates a persistent copy that you control, ensuring the link remains valid even after the original submission message is deleted.

Here’s a breakdown of the workflow and a Python code example using the `discord.py` library.

-----

### \#\# Workflow

1.  **Configuration:** Create a command for server administrators to designate a specific channel as the "file archive" (e.g., `/set-archive-channel #music-submissions-storage`). The bot will store this channel's ID.

2.  **Message Detection:** The bot listens for new messages in the designated submission channel(s).

3.  **Attachment Check:** When a message is detected, the bot checks if it contains any file attachments (`message.attachments`).

4.  **Copy Operation:** For each attachment, the bot will:

      * Read the file's content into memory as bytes.
      * Send a new message containing a copy of that file to the configured archive channel.
      * Get the new, permanent URL from the attachment in the message it just sent.

5.  **Submission Processing:** The bot uses this **new, permanent URL** to create the song submission entry in your database or queue.

6.  **Cleanup:** After successfully copying the file and processing the submission, the bot deletes the original user message from the submission channel.

### \#\# Python `discord.py` Example

This example demonstrates how to implement the configuration command and the `on_message` event handler to perform the copy-and-delete operation.

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import io
import os # For environment variables

# --- Basic Bot Setup ---
# Make sure to enable Message Content Intent in the Discord Developer Portal
intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.messages = True
intents.message_content = True 

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=intents)

# A simple dictionary to hold server-specific configurations
# In a real bot, you'd use a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
server_configs = {}

# --- Bot Events ---

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Logged in as {bot.user}')
    print('Bot is ready to receive submissions.')

@bot.event
async def on_message(message: discord.Message):
    # Ignore messages from the bot itself
    if message.author == bot.user:
        return

    # Check if the message is in a configured submission channel and has attachments
    # For this example, we assume ANY channel with an attachment is a submission
    # In a real bot, you'd check if message.channel.id is a designated submission channel
    if not message.attachments:
        return

    # --- Main Logic ---
    guild_id = message.guild.id
    config = server_configs.get(guild_id)

    if not config or not config.get('archive_channel_id'):
        # Optional: Notify the user that the bot isn't configured
        # await message.channel.send("Sorry, the submission system is not configured yet.")
        return

    try:
        archive_channel = bot.get_channel(config['archive_channel_id'])
        if not archive_channel:
            print(f"Error: Archive channel with ID {config['archive_channel_id']} not found.")
            return
            
        new_attachment_urls = []

        # Loop through all attachments in the original message
        for attachment in message.attachments:
            # Read the file into an in-memory buffer
            file_bytes = await attachment.read()
            buffer = io.BytesIO(file_bytes)
            
            # Create a discord.File object to send
            new_file = discord.File(buffer, filename=attachment.filename)

            # Send the file to the archive channel
            archive_message = await archive_channel.send(
                f"Archived submission from {message.author.mention} in {message.channel.mention}",
                file=new_file
            )
            
            # Get the new, permanent URL
            new_url = archive_message.attachments[0].url
            new_attachment_urls.append(new_url)
            print(f"File '{attachment.filename}' archived. New URL: {new_url}")

        # --- Process the submission with the new URLs ---
        # Here, you would add the new_attachment_urls to your database or queue
        print(f"Processing submission for {message.author} with URLs: {new_attachment_urls}")
        
        # Finally, delete the original message
        await message.delete()
        print(f"Original message from {message.author} deleted.")

    except discord.errors.Forbidden:
        print("Error: Bot lacks permissions to send messages, attach files, or delete messages.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


# --- Configuration Command ---

@bot.slash_command(name="set-archive-channel", description="Sets the channel for storing song submissions.")
@commands.has_permissions(administrator=True) # Only admins can use this
async def set_archive_channel(ctx, channel: discord.TextChannel):
    guild_id = ctx.guild.id
    if guild_id not in server_configs:
        server_configs[guild_id] = {}
    
    server_configs[guild_id]['archive_channel_id'] = channel.id
    
    await ctx.respond(f"✅ Success! The archive channel has been set to {channel.mention}.", ephemeral=True)

# Run the bot with your token
# bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
```

### \#\# Important Considerations

  * **Permissions:** Your bot will need the following permissions:
      * In the **submission channel**: `View Channel`, `Read Message History`, `Manage Messages` (to delete).
      * In the **archive channel**: `View Channel`, `Send Messages`, `Attach Files`. It's best to make this archive channel private so only the bot and reviewers can see it.
  * **Intents:** You **must** enable the `Message Content` Privileged Gateway Intent in your bot's settings on the Discord Developer Portal for the `on_message` event to work as expected.
  * **Error Handling:** The code includes basic `try...except` blocks. A production-level bot should have more robust error handling, such as notifying an admin if the archive channel is deleted or if permissions are revoked.
